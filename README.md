# Mobile Development

## App Technical Features
Here are the app technical features of the application:
* Utilizing the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language for application development.
* Implementing [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle all aspects related to data connection from Android to the Internet.
* Integrating the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com) to retrieve the user's current location.

## App Development Roadmap
During the development of the application, we followed two main processes: Implementation to Design and Implementation to Apps.

### Implementation to Design
In the Implementation to Design phase, we utilized [Figma](https://figma.com), a web-based application, for the application design process. This allowed us to create a comprehensive visual representation of the application.

### Implementation to Apps
Moving on to the Implementation to Apps phase, we utilized [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language to bring the design to life. We meticulously implemented the UI Design, ensuring that it accurately reflected the previously created design. Additionally, we incorporated several essential features. For data connection management, we employed [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), which efficiently handles all aspects related to data connection from Android to the internet. Lastly, to obtain the user's current location, we integrated [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com) into the application.

By following these processes, we were able to develop the application with professionalism and attention to detail, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.
