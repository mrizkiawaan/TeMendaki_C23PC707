## Executive Summary
TeMendaki is an open trip platform that allows individuals to join group tours with strangers instead of traveling alone on a hiking trip. TeMendaki offers a range of features to users, including the ability to search for and book open trips, join existing tours, and access articles that educate newbie hikers before their hiking adventures.

As the popularity of open trip services increases, so does the risk of scams. Nowadays, anyone can easily create an Instagram account for an open trip service at a very low cost, specifically to deceive inexperienced hikers. Such scams can result in fatal risks, as exemplified by the viral news of the Rinjani Open Trip scam in January 2022. This not only endangers the lives of hikers but also tarnishes Indonesia's tourism image.

To address this critical issue, TeMendaki plans to facilitate curated local tour guides in organizing proper open trips. This benefits end users, especially newbie hikers, who can rely on trusted hiking open trip options. TeMendaki ensures that the trip itineraries are well-planned and executed according to a standard operating procedure, minimizing risks.

This concept benefits both the local tour guides and the hikers. Local tour guides do not need to spend additional money on marketing their services, while hikers are provided with various trusted open trip options. Moreover, this open trip platform allows users to meet new people from different backgrounds and cultures.

## App Technical Features
Here are the app technical features of the application:
* Utilizing the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language for application development.
* Implementing [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle all aspects related to data connection from Android to the Internet.
* Integrating the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com) to retrieve the user's current location.

## App Development Roadmap
During the development of the application, we followed two main processes: Implementation to Design and Implementation to Apps.

### Implementation to Design
In the Implementation to Design phase, we utilized [Figma](https://figma.com), a web-based application, for the application design process. This allowed us to create a comprehensive visual representation of the application.

### Implentation to Apps
Moving on to the Implementation to Apps phase, we utilized [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language to bring the design to life. We meticulously implemented the UI Design, ensuring that it accurately reflected the previously created design. Additionally, we incorporated several essential features. For data connection management, we employed [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), which efficiently handles all aspects related to data connection from Android to the internet. Lastly, to obtain the user's current location, we integrated [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com) into the application.

By following these processes, we were able to develop the application with professionalism and attention to detail, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.
